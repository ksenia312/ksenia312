### Hi there (:

#### I'm Kseniia, here's my expierence

I started programming when I was 15 years old. Since then, I've been working hard to improve my skills and explore the world of technology. I spent a year learning frontend development, specifically focusing on **React** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71008947/174482232-11c2b7b8-09c5-4e3e-a550-775d00339f0d.png" alt="drawing" width="15"/> with **Typescript**. This helped me understand the basics of building websites. I enjoyed this activity and learned a lot from it.

Currently, I work as a **Flutter** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71008947/174482202-c5acd0c3-9a5d-4415-bd64-f42347660f1a.png" alt="drawing" width="15"/> developer, and I find the framework very inspiring. I'm constantly learning and trying to improve my knowledge in this area. Programming is not just my job, it's also a hobby that I really enjoy. I've been studying at ITMO University since 2020, where I'm expanding my education in the field of technology.

I work with **Dart** now, and it has become a significant part of my programming journey. Additionally, I have experience with **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **Python**. Moreover, I have some familiarity with **C#** and **R**. I've been practicing English every day since 2021 using the Duolingo app and I have reached a **B2** level.

In my free time, I like to play **chess**<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71008947/174480520-1b78dbba-8538-4630-a9bc-4e3a38b2a87d.png" alt="drawing" width="15"/>. It's a game that I find enjoyable and it helps me relax.
