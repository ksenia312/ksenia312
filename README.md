## Hi there ðŸ˜€

### I'm [Kseniia](https://xenikii.one), here's my experience

#### Introduction
I started programming at 15, and I've been actively improving my skills ever since. I spent over a year diving into frontend development, particularly focusing on **React** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71008947/174482232-11c2b7b8-09c5-4e3e-a550-775d00339f0d.png" alt="drawing" width="15"/> and **Typescript**, which gave me a solid understanding of building websites. That's how I started my journey in the tech world.

#### Key skills 
Currently, I work as a Full-stack Dart developer, and I have an in-depth knowledge of **Flutter** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71008947/174482202-c5acd0c3-9a5d-4415-bd64-f42347660f1a.png" alt="drawing" width="15"/> as well as pure Dart. I am looking to master all aspects of application development, both for mobile devices and the web. In my work, I use custom Dart packages to create modular architectures, and I also apply this language to backend development. Programming is not just my job, it's also a hobby that I really enjoy.

#### About languages
I work with **Dart** now, and it has become a significant part of my programming journey. Additionally, I have experience with **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **Python**. Moreover, I have some familiarity with **C#** and **R**. 

#### Other
Since 2020, I've been studying at ITMO University, where I'm expanding my education in the field of technology. Since 2021, I have been improving my English skills on Duolingo, reaching a B2 level. In 2023, I began my journey to learn Dutch, and while I am still a beginner, I am putting in a lot of effort. In my free time, I like to play **chess**<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71008947/174480520-1b78dbba-8538-4630-a9bc-4e3a38b2a87d.png" alt="drawing" width="15"/>. It's a game that I find enjoyable and it helps me relax.
